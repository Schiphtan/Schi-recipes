        It’s easy to resolve to eat more plant-based healthy dinners, but actually doing it is another matter entirely. Here’s one way to make it mega-delicious: this Vegan Tacos Recipe! There are lots of ways to make a vegan taco, but this one is our favorite. It’s filled with hearty, spiced walnut taco meat that tastes remarkably similar to the real thing. Add refried beans, your favorite classic toppings, and dollop with a creamy, spicy sauce. These were a major hit at our house. Eating vegan dinners never tasted so good!

        There are lots of plant-based meat substitutes available these days: which speeds up the prep of these vegan tacos. But many brands can have additives and odd ingredients, and aren’t all that different from the processed food many home cooks like to avoid. So we like to make our own!
